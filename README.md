#IMAGE-GENERATION-USING-COMFY-UI-AND-STABLE-DIFFUSION

This is my Internship Project as part of AICTE Internship on AI: Transformative Learning with TechSaksham – A joint CSR initiative of Microsoft & SAP

This project demonstrates the use of Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI for generating images from text prompts. ComfyUI's node-based interface provides a flexible and powerful way to design and execute complex image generation workflows, making Stable Diffusion more accessible and controllable.



##🎨 AI Image Generation with Stable Diffusion & ComfyUI


###🚀 Overview
This project explores AI-powered image generation using Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI. By leveraging latent diffusion models (LDMs), we can generate high-quality images from text prompts with fine-grained control over details.

🔹 Why Stable Diffusion?
✅ Open-source & powerful 💡
✅ Generates high-resolution images 📸
✅ Customizable with LoRA, ControlNet, & IP-Adapters 🎛️
✅ Works on consumer GPUs ⚡

🔹 Why ComfyUI?
✅ Node-based workflow for better control 🛠️
✅ Supports multi-stage processing 📊
✅ Visual, flexible, and modular 🚀
✅ Enhances image refinement & customization 🎨

###📌 Features
✔️ Generate images from text prompts 📝 → 🎨
✔️ Modify & refine images using ControlNet & LoRA
✔️ Node-based workflow for intuitive editing 🔄
✔️ Batch processing & automation 🔥
✔️ Custom fine-tuning for unique styles 🎭
